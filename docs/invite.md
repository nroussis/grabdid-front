#Hello there.

#This is a doc for invite.html file.

Pagination made trough different scripts for all pagination cases. 

    -invite-pagination.js -- pagination for invited table
    -signedup-pagination.js -- pagination for signed up table
    -qualified-pagination.js -- pagination for qualified table

The main setting you'll use I suppose is the amount of items on every page so it is easy to change through the variable

"elsOnPage" and it's variations on different scripts (it is very easy to find)

Note: elsOnPage is now set to 2.
