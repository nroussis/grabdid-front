- PAGINATION
---------------
JS- pagination and sorting script is js/all-coupons-sort.js

Please note that JS-pagination will work correctly only if coupon element has class "coupon--paginated".

Value of visible items can be changed by changing "elsOnPage" variable (2 by default).

---------------
- SORTING
---------------
Please notice that sorting works on classes of element so there is little help:

To make sure that coupon is sorted properly please be sure that it has literation class. Examples:

"coupon-A"                      "coupon-0"        
"coupon-B"      and numeric     "coupon-5"
"coupon-C"                      "coupon-9"
